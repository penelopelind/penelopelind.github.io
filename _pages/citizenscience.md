I am also passionate about citizen science, particulalry environmental citizen science. 

I am active on two biodiversity citizen science platforms -- [eBird](https://ebird.org/) and [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org). 

On both of these platforms users record their observations of nature. While eBird is solely focussed on bird sightings and does not require photos or sound recordings, iNaturalist curates observations of all organisms (plants, animals, fungi etc) and requires users to upload photos or sound recordings.

My iNaturalist username is [tuppsnz](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/2702800) and to date I have recorded 3,864 iNaturalist observations of 1,072 unique species. The majority of these are not bird sightings since I primarily share my bird sightings in eBird [here]( https://ebird.org/profile/MTQzNjM0OA).

A tree view of the observations I've recorded in iNaturalist.

My favourite order of insect to observe are odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and lepidoptera (butterflies and moths).

One of my all time favourite photographs I've taken is of this Graphic Flutterer (*Rhyothemis graphiptera*)
