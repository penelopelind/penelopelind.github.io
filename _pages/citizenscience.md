I am also passionate about citizen science, particulalry environmental citizen science. 

I am active on two biodiversity citizen science platforms -- [eBird](https://ebird.org/) and [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org). Both of these platforms users record their observations of nature. While eBird is solely focussed on bird sightings and does not require photos or sound recordings, iNaturalist curates observations of all organisms (plants, animals, fungi etc) and requires users to upload photos or sound recordings.

My iNaturalist username is [tuppsnz](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/2702800) and to date, I have recorded 3,864 iNaturalist observations from 1,072 unique species. The majority of these are not bird sightings since I primarily record those in eBird [here]( https://ebird.org/profile/MTQzNjM0OA)
