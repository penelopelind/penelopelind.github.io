I'm a statistical geneticist in the [Psychiatric Genetics group](https://www.qimrb.edu.au/researchers-and-labs/psychiatric-genetics) at QIMR Berghofer in Brisbane, Australia. I'm a molecular biologist by training, and my research is underpinned by a strong foundation in statistical genetic methodologies used in complex trait analysis. 

My primary research interest focuses on dissecting the genetic etiology of substance use and addictive behaviors such as disordered gambling. During my research career I have transitioned from being based in a wet-lab to a dry lab. As such, I have expertise both in conducting high-through put genetic studies and also in the analysis of large-scale genetic and phenotypic datasets. I also have broad experience in recruiting new study cohorts in collaboration with the Services Australia (formerly the Australian Department of Human Services), including the [ClozaGene Study](https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbae065), [Australian Genetics of Bipolar Disorder Study](https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674231195571) and [censusADHD Study](https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674221089234) cohorts. 

I have been a Chief Investigator on >$7M of competitive grants, including five Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Project Grants, two of which have awarded AUD$1,433,109 in funding for alcohol-related research, and two Medical Research Future Fund grants. I have demonstrated scientific leadership in participant recruitment, DNA sample collection, and survey design and data collection. 

My publication record to includes 130 peer reviewed publications with >18,000 citations and an H-index of 54 (Scopus, August 4, 2025). From 2020-2025, I have had 49 publications and a Field-Weighted Citation Impact of 6.15 (SciVal, August 4, 2025).

I have also built a strong collaborative network, both nationally and internationally, with researchers in the substance use, statistical and psychiatric genetics fields, including collaborations with researchers from the GWAS and Sequencing Consortium of Alcohol and Nicotine Use (GSCAN) and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC). I am a co-Chair of the international Genetics of Gambling working group of the PGC with research groups from Australia, United States, and the Netherlands. I am the primary analyst of the Genetic Analyst Working group for the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium, and I contribute significantly to the Substance Use Disorder and Bipolar Disorder working groups of the PGC.
