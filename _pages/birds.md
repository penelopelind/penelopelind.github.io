A year or two before I became I birder, I started drawing birds. Then I started birding and began photographing them. While my art and photography have slowed down I haven't stopped!

I post my bird [art](https://www.instagram.com/drtupps/) and [photography](https://www.instagram.com/drtupps.birding/) to Instagram.
