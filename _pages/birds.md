Outside of being a scientist and a Mum, I love birds. Years before I officially became I birder, I started drawing birds in 2014 as part of a 100 Days of Drawing challenge. The first bird art I ever made (an Australian Kookaburra) was on day 5 of this challenge and I never looked back! Then I started birding in 2019 and soon began photographing them. While my art and photography have slowed down I haven't stopped!

I post my bird [art](https://www.instagram.com/drtupps/) and [photography](https://www.instagram.com/drtupps.birding/) to Instagram.

### Here is some of my bird art:
